        <h1>About Rod</h1>
        <p>Rod Linton began shaping trees into living sculpture in the 1980s. What started with a humble nursery pine grew into a lifelong study in patience, proportion, and care—guided in life and spirit by his late wife, Deb.</p>
        <p>This catalogue exists to document each tree: its species, style, age, pot, and the countless decisions that brought it to its current form. It is both a practical record and a tribute.</p>

        <p>For Deb — whose love and encouragement are woven through every branch and leaf.</p>
